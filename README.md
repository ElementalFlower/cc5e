# Custom Compendium for D&D 5e
This module is a (mostly) full compendium of _Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition_ content that has been modified with hombrew rules I use. In it's current state it is complete enough to be usable. **The original Fifth Edition rules are not included, only modified rules.**
## Module Integrations
This module makes heavy use of <a href="https://gitlab.com/tposney/dae">Dynamic Active Effects,</a> but is not required.

I recommend installing <a href="https://github.com/TheGiddyLimit/plutonium-next">Plutonium</a> as a lot of CC5e's item icons are tied to this module as this time.
## Changes Made to the Source Material
### Primary Homebrew Sources
This module usus two major homebrew rulesets which override the core rules. On top of this, some rules have been altered to fit custom rules.
<h4><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iVXZwJXahbYeITWFsU1Xfo8OCecxmM20Z4K22DZ83Pc/edit#gid=1355379407">Silver Standard 5e</a></h4>
All mentions of gp, or reference to gold as money are changed to sp or silver. It is assumes a base currency of silver, which is worth what gold used to be before changes (100cp).
<h4><a href="https://www.gmbinder.com/share/-LA-cZ6gjstFUUidNmIP">Weapons, Remastered, Revised</a></h4>
This has been edited further; adding weapons and other customizations. This homebrew completely overhauls the Weapons and Armour in the game, replacing the ones from the source material.

### Alterations Made to _Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition_
Changes made to the source material can be found in Appendix CC5e-A: Changelog. I cannot be bothered to write it all out again; the above summary gives a good explaination.
