Clerics of a god of light are enlightened souls infused with radiance and the power of their gods' discerning vision, charged with chasing away lies and burning away darkness.</p>\n<h3>Light Domain Spells</h3>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Cleric Level</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Spells</strong></td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1st</td>\n<td>@Compendium[cc5e.spells.5aENRLChJhhOZVyv]{Burning Hands}, @Compendium[cc5e.spells.I2OlSLgRuIGpoR7y]{Faerie Fire}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3rd</td>\n<td>@Compendium[cc5e.spells.EX354mc0duhpewBp]{Flaming Sphere}, @Compendium[cc5e.spells.dijuntPsJLkBcevE]{Scorching Ray}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5th</td>\n<td>@Compendium[cc5e.spells.YniGko1A4332kwog]{Daylight}, @Compendium[cc5e.spells.iFucWpjuZfpNri9E]{Fireball}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7th</td>\n<td>@Compendium[cc5e.spells.70YM0wBRudltsIEL]{Guardian of Faith}, @Compendium[cc5e.spells.ZaQ7wJJLNZyuNGn3]{Wall of Fire}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9th</td>\n<td>@Compendium[cc5e.spells.vVr16pgwBPNWXN5a]{Flame Strike}, @Compendium[cc5e.spells.PZD4USdNXUBJn0EU]{Scrying}</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>Light Domain Features</h3>\n<p>1st Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.7Ca2jyZWk5lPtVzo]{Bonus Cantrip}, @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.4MrnwiyB0AIeBtUe]{Warding Flare}</p>\n<p>2nd Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.S0W56XPphSryHadn]{Channel Divinity: Radiance of the Dawn}</p>\n<p>6th Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.Tv2qugRLqnFZu5KB]{Improved Flare}</p>\n<p>8th Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.DiIUkZehS0uDPAT8]{Potent Spellcasting}</p>\n<p>17th Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.awVT3EkzD9Z46Cqa]{Corona of Light}</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Player's Handbook","identifier":"light-domain","classIdentifier":"cleric","advancement":[{"_id":"c0o4trgb8ssv54db","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.cc5e.class-classfeatures.7Ca2jyZWk5lPtVzo","Compendium.cc5e.class-classfeatures.4MrnwiyB0AIeBtUe"],"optional":false},"value":{},"level":1,"title":"Domain Features","icon":""},{"_id":"9tk26eorr9acykhk","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.cc5e.class-classfeatures.S0W56XPphSryHadn"],"optional":false},"value":{},"level":2,"title":"Domain Features","icon":""},{"_id":"mhogfp3hgwr58z4t","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.cc5e.class-classfeatures.Tv2qugRLqnFZu5KB"],"optional":false},"value":{},"level":6,"title":"Domain Features","icon":""},{"_id":"p88lem91c7ims1oq","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.cc5e.class-classfeatures.DiIUkZehS0uDPAT8"],"optional":false},"value":{},"level":8,"title":"Domain Features","icon":""},{"_id":"wsws60wm36oyazfc","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.cc5e.class-classfeatures.awVT3EkzD9Z46Cqa"],"optional":false},"value":{},"level":17,"title":"Domain Features","icon":""},{"_id":"v5wk2pb9dq4t4u32","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.cc5e.spells.5aENRLChJhhOZVyv","Compendium.cc5e.spells.I2OlSLgRuIGpoR7y"],"optional":false},"value":{},"level":1,"title":"Domain Spells","icon":""},{"_id":"i0i2u0nfd6ylzod6","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.cc5e.spells.EX354mc0duhpewBp","Compendium.cc5e.spells.dijuntPsJLkBcevE"],"optional":false},"value":{},"level":3,"title":"Domain Spells","icon":""},{"_id":"h5jcvuujebe7rheo","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.cc5e.spells.YniGko1A4332kwog","Compendium.cc5e.spells.iFucWpjuZfpNri9E"],"optional":false},"value":{},"level":5,"title":"Domain Spells","icon":""},{"_id":"738adhjnclqtsi1v","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.cc5e.spells.70YM0wBRudltsIEL","Compendium.cc5e.spells.ZaQ7wJJLNZyuNGn3"],"optional":false},"value":{},"level":7,"title":"Domain Spells","icon":""},{"_id":"b03wc8hmu5r0613j","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.cc5e.spells.vVr16pgwBPNWXN5a","Compendium.cc5e.spells.PZD4USdNXUBJn0EU"],"optional":false},"value":{},"level":9,"title":"Domain Spells","icon":""},{"_id":"ifdo09odsl9f8hfc","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.cc5e.spells.HKgeWs3FIiePlQkr"],"optional":false},"value":{},"level":1,"title":"Domain Features: Bonus Cantrip","icon":""}],"spellcasting":{"progression":"none","ability":""}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"THB0iiaRQeds6BDT":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_u45qxqq0wnn","path":"Class Features#/CF_SEP/Cleric","color":"#000000"}}}

With a Charisma of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell cure wounds, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2ndlevel slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\n<p>You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of paladin spells requires time spent in prayer and meditation: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\n<table style=\"width:99.2288%;height:352px\"

Other war gods (such as Tempus, Nike, and Nuada) take a more neutral stance, promoting war in all its manifestations and supporting warriors in any circumstance.</p>\n<h3>War Domain Spells</h3>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Cleric Level</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Spells</strong></td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1st</td>\n<td>@Compendium[cc5e.spells.1sfH7M54TSD7s34t]{Divine Favor}, @Compendium[cc5e.spells.YkztycD5yGrXp2Zg]{Shield of Faith}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3rd</td>\n<td>@Compendium[cc5e.spells.cAJv1e6hUqumcrcC]{Magic Weapon}, @Compendium[cc5e.spells.cFBwsTgxtG0kGNjk]{Spiritual Weapon}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5th</td>\n<td>@Compendium[cc5e.spells.bL5fRxU8ECXmFXTq]{Crusader's Mantle}, @Compendium[cc5e.spells.5rD1Xx0twtvjBVn1]{Spirit Guardians}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7th</td>\n<td>@Compendium[cc5e.spells.BJIBrWCGaTSMqAhn]{Freedom of Movement}, @Compendium[cc5e.spells.WoVc4SVDgsPd9VvU]{Stoneskin}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9th</td>\n<td>@Compendium[cc5e.spells.vVr16pgwBPNWXN5a]{Flame Strike}, @Compendium[cc5e.spells.TT2PtgnKoRIgheE5]{Hold Monster}</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>War Domain Features</h3>\n<p>1st Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.1tFJMxnxnZO11l07]{Bonus Proficiency}, @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.GdMmhOWoJl1L1SSC]{War Priest}</p>\n<p>2nd Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.tPiv941vuD7T9Gy0]{Channel Divinity: Guided Strike}</p>\n<p>6th Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.sIZjjyJ4Ar7QVp8f]{Channel Divinity: War God's Blessing}</p>\n<p>8th Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.KAeaPPKZRXX28mWD]{Divine Strike}</p>\n<p>17th Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.PXabmi6SP31gasCg]{Avatar of Battle}</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Player's Handbook","identifier":"war-domain","classIdentifier":"cleric","advancement":[{"_id":"c0o4trgb8ssv54db","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.cc5e.class-classfeatures.1tFJMxnxnZO11l07","Compendium.cc5e.class-classfeatures.GdMmhOWoJl1L1SSC"],"optional":false},"value":{},"level":1,"title":"Domain Features","icon":""},{"_id":"9tk26eorr9acykhk","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.cc5e.class-classfeatures.tPiv941vuD7T9Gy0"],"optional":false},"value":{},"level":2,"title":"Domain Features","icon":""},{"_id":"mhogfp3hgwr58z4t","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.cc5e.class-classfeatures.sIZjjyJ4Ar7QVp8f"],"optional":false},"value":{},"level":6,"title":"Domain Features","icon":""},{"_id":"p88lem91c7ims1oq","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.cc5e.class-classfeatures.KAeaPPKZRXX28mWD"],"optional":false},"value":{},"level":8,"title":"Domain Features","icon":""},{"_id":"wsws60wm36oyazfc","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.cc5e.class-classfeatures.PXabmi6SP31gasCg"],"optional":false},"value":{},"level":17,"title":"Domain Features","icon":""},{"_id":"v5wk2pb9dq4t4u32","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.cc5e.spells.1sfH7M54TSD7s34t","Compendium.cc5e.spells.YkztycD5yGrXp2Zg"],"optional":false},"value":{},"level":1,"title":"Domain Spells","icon":""},{"_id":"i0i2u0nfd6ylzod6","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.cc5e.spells.cAJv1e6hUqumcrcC","Compendium.cc5e.spells.cFBwsTgxtG0kGNjk"],"optional":false},"value":{},"level":3,"title":"Domain Spells","icon":""},{"_id":"h5jcvuujebe7rheo","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.cc5e.spells.bL5fRxU8ECXmFXTq","Compendium.cc5e.spells.5rD1Xx0twtvjBVn1"],"optional":false},"value":{},"level":5,"title":"Domain Spells","icon":""},{"_id":"738adhjnclqtsi1v","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.cc5e.spells.BJIBrWCGaTSMqAhn","Compendium.cc5e.spells.WoVc4SVDgsPd9VvU"],"optional":false},"value":{},"level":7,"title":"Domain Spells","icon":""},{"_id":"b03wc8hmu5r0613j","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.cc5e.spells.vVr16pgwBPNWXN5a","Compendium.cc5e.spells.TT2PtgnKoRIgheE5"],"optional":false},"value":{},"level":9,"title":"Domain Spells","icon":""},{"_id":"8ze1xvszexcp6llu","type":"ScaleValue","configuration":{"identifier":"divine-strike","type":"dice","distance":{"units":""},"scale":{"8":{"n":1,"die":8},"14":{"n":2,"die":8}}},"value":{},"title":"Divine Strike Damage","icon":""}],"spellcasting":{"progression":"none","ability":""}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"THB0iiaRQeds6BDT":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_4vjp5mlhv6","path":"Class Features#/CF_SEP/Cleric","color":"#000000"},"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.world.temp.CHbaJiXOqllDt9Tt"}}}

Tempest gods send their clerics to inspire fear in the common folk, either to keep those folk on the path of righteousness or to encourage them to offer sacrifices of propitiation to ward off divine wrath.</p>\n<h3>Tempest Domain Spells</h3>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Cleric Level</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Spells</strong></td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1st</td>\n<td>@Compendium[cc5e.spells.rbIMmoQaKLspHJnS]{Fog Cloud}, @Compendium[cc5e.spells.pfhP6otgZflTiwNH]{Thunderwave}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3rd</td>\n<td>@Compendium[cc5e.spells.BHURnXhALF0ifB3p]{Gust of Wind}, @Compendium[cc5e.spells.iB8C3aPLYbfgvFQs]{Shatter}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5th</td>\n<td>@Compendium[cc5e.spells.K8lh84b37BXvoDsq]{Call Lightning}, @Compendium[cc5e.spells.2VL4RvrHgWkNSJHz]{Sleet Storm}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7th</td>\n<td>@Compendium[cc5e.spells.MTcdJHetcLORaL1m]{Control Water}, @Compendium[cc5e.spells.7r8bGVjU91d6QlCS]{Ice Storm}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9th</td>\n<td>@Compendium[cc5e.spells.tjLxAo6133kmPIPC]{Destructive Wave}, @Compendium[cc5e.spells.dDxyGK16KXAukrbf]{Insect Plague}</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>Tempest Domain Features</h3>\n<p>1st Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.kFYfcVyoUJTPWBww]{Bonus Proficiencies}, @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.XwdzWeRE9VxG2pAg]{Wrath of the Storm}</p>\n<p>2nd Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.nbQytLPfoXLenUUw]{Channel Divinity: Destructive Wrath}</p>\n<p>6th Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.WEoRpw7QHHpIk10C]{Thunderous Strike}</p>\n<p>8th Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.mJ0kxJpVjBqPc6RE]{Divine Strike}</p>\n<p>17th Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.VFrW2GtjmOujf5zD]{Stormborn}</p>\n<h2>Trickery Domain</h2>\n<p>Gods of trickery â such as Tymora, Beshaba, Olidammara, the Traveler, Garl Glittergold, and Loki â are mischief-makers and instigators who stand as a constant challenge to the accepted order among both gods and mortals.

It can make heroes of ordinary people. It can be desperate and horrific, with acts of cruelty and cowardice eclipsing instances of excellence and courage. In either case, the gods of war watch over warriors and reward them for their great deeds. The clerics of such gods excel in battle, inspiring others to fight the good fight or offering acts of violence as prayers. Gods of war include champions of honor and chivalry (such as Torm, Heironeous, and Kiri-Jolith) as well as gods of destruction and pillage (such as Erythnul, the Fury, Gruumsh, and Ares) and gods of conquest and domination (such as Bane, Hextor, and Maglubiyet). Other war gods (such as Tempus, Nike, and Nuada) take a more neutral stance, promoting war in all its manifestations and supporting warriors in any circumstance.</p>\n<h3>War Domain Spells</h3>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Cleric Level</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Spells</strong></td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1st</td>\n<td>@Compendium[cc5e.spells.1sfH7M54TSD7s34t]{Divine Favor}, @Compendium[cc5e.spells.YkztycD5yGrXp2Zg]{Shield of Faith}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3rd</td>\n<td>@Compendium[cc5e.spells.cAJv1e6hUqumcrcC]{Magic Weapon}, @Compendium[cc5e.spells.cFBwsTgxtG0kGNjk]{Spiritual Weapon}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5th</td>\n<td>@Compendium[cc5e.spells.bL5fRxU8ECXmFXTq]{Crusader's Mantle}, @Compendium[cc5e.spells.5rD1Xx0twtvjBVn1]{Spirit Guardians}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7th</td>\n<td>@Compendium[cc5e.spells.BJIBrWCGaTSMqAhn]{Freedom of Movement}, @Compendium[cc5e.spells.WoVc4SVDgsPd9VvU]{Stoneskin}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9th</td>\n<td>@Compendium[cc5e.spells.vVr16pgwBPNWXN5a]{Flame Strike}, @Compendium[cc5e.spells.TT2PtgnKoRIgheE5]{Hold Monster}</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>War Domain Features</h3>\n<p>1st Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.1tFJMxnxnZO11l07]{Bonus Proficiency}, @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.GdMmhOWoJl1L1SSC]{War Priest}</p>\n<p>2nd Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.tPiv941vuD7T9Gy0]{Channel Divinity: Guided Strike}</p>\n<p>6th Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.sIZjjyJ4Ar7QVp8f]{Channel Divinity: War God's Blessing}</p>\n<p>8th Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.KAeaPPKZRXX28mWD]{Divine Strike}</p>\n<p>17th Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.PXabmi6SP31gasCg]{Avatar of Battle}</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Player's Handbook","identifier":"cleric","levels":1,"hitDice":"d8","hitDiceUsed":0,"advancement":[{"_id":"p1b15wulzym2pmzx","type":"HitPoints","configuration":{},"value":{}},{"_id":"yjukjh2vvcho61oq","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.cc5e.class-classfeatures.E5ziJP43em0WEAOQ","Compendium.cc5e.class-classfeatures.MGKMbhfEk4Ef3B2z"],"optional":false},"value":{},"level":1,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"boex6chvdnw2x39u","type":"ScaleValue","configuration":{"identifier":"channel-divinity","type":"number","distance":{"units":""},"scale":{"2":{"value":1},"6":{"value":2},"18":{"value":3}}},"value":{},"title":"Channel Divinity Uses","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"oh5ii2hd71r1fia5","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.cc5e.class-classfeatures.8dW493ln37ecwgx3","Compendium.cc5e.class-classfeatures.tqQe7JNDb16CwAW5"],"optional":false},"value":{},"level":2,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"r2ouzovjqrmaqr0r","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.cc5e.class-classfeatures.JjpcEl0Y4oQgJd2O"],"optional":false},"value":{},"level":5,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"6drvkga3qfmza1h5","type":"ScaleValue","configuration":{"identifier":"destroy-undead","type":"number","distance":{"units":""},"scale":{"5":{"value":0.5},"8":{"value":1},"11":{"value":2},"14":{"value":3},"17":{"value":4}}},"value":{},"title":"Destroy Undead CR","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"h0atv4lbnheihi5p","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.cc5e.class-classfeatures.PVodOKhOZwlDEJeE"],"optional":false},"value":{},"level":10,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""}],"saves":["wis","cha"],"skills":{"number":2,"choices":["his","ins","med","per","rel"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"full","ability":"wis"},"subclass":"","damage":{"parts":[]},"critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":null}},"ownership":{"default":0,"THB0iiaRQeds6BDT":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.286","createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":1664317977588,"lastModifiedBy":"THB0iiaRQeds6BDT"}}

To do so, choose a number of wizard spells from your spellbook equal to your Intelligence modifier + your wizard level (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p><p>For example, if you're a 3rd-level wizard, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 16, your list of prepared spells can include six spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination, chosen from your spellbook. If you prepare the 1st-level spell magic missile, you can cast it using a 1st-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p><p>You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of wizard spells requires time spent studying your spellbook and memorizing the incantations and gestures you must make to cast the spell: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\n<table border=\"0\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td rowspan=\"2\">Level</td>\n<td rowspan=\"2\">Cantrips Known</td>\n<td colspan=\"9\">âSpell Slots per Spell Levelâ</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>1st</td>\n<td>2nd</td>\n<td>3rd</td>\n<td>4th</td>\n<td>5th</td>\n<td>6th</td>\n<td>7th</td>\n<td>8th</td>\n<td>9th</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1st</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2nd</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3rd</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9th</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>10th</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11th</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12th</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>13th</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14th</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>15th</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>16th</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>-</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17th</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>18th</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>19th</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>20th</td>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>1</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>Spellcasting Ability</h3>\n<p>Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your wizard spells, since you learn your spells through dedicated study and memorization.

{"name":"Spellcasting (Artificer)","type":"feat","img":"icons/svg/item-bag.svg","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>You've studied the workings of magic and how to cast spells, channeling the magic through objects. To observers, you don't appear to be casting spells in a conventional way; you appear to produce wonders from mundane items and outlandish inventions.</p>\n<h3 id=\"toc7\">Tools Required</h3>\n<p>You produce your artificer spell effects through your tools. You must have a spellcasting focus-specifically thieves' tools or some kind of artisan's tool-in hand when you cast any spell with this Spellcasting feature (meaning the spell has an \"M\" component when you cast it). You must be proficient with the tool to use it in this way. See the equipment chapter in the Player's Handbook for descriptions of these tools.</p>\n<p>After you gain the Infuse Item feature at 2nd level, you can also use any item bearing one of your infusions as a spellcasting focus.</p>\n<h3 id=\"toc8\">Cantrips (0-Level Spells)</h3>\n<p>At 1st level, you know two cantrips of your choice from the artificer spell list. At higher levels, you learn additional artificer can trips of your choice, as shown in the Cantrips Known column of the Artificer table.</p>\n<p>When you gain a level in this class, you can replace one of the artificer cantrips you know with another cantrip from the artificer spell list.</p>\n<h3 id=\"toc9\">Preparing and Casting Spells</h3>\n<p>The Artificer table shows how many spell slots you have to cast your artificer spells. To cast one of your artificer spells of 1st level or higher, you must expend a slot of the spell's level or higher. You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a long rest.</p>\n<p>You prepare the list of artificer spells that are available for you to cast, choosing from the artificer spell list. When you do so, choose a number of artificer spells equal to your Intelligence modifier + half your artificer level, rounded down (minimum of one spell). The spells must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>\n<p>For example, if you are a 5th-level artificer, you have four 1st-level and two 2nd-level spell slots. With an Intelligence of 14, your list of prepared spells can include four spells of 1st or 2nd level, in any combination. If you prepare the 1st-level spell Cure Wounds, you can cast it using a lst-level or a 2nd-level slot. Casting the spell doesn't remove it from your list of prepared spells.</p>\n<p>You can change your list of prepared spells when you finish a long rest. Preparing a new list of artificer spells requires time spent tinkering with your spellcasting focuses: at least 1 minute per spell level for each spell on your list.</p>\n<table

Or your birth might align with an ancient prophecy, marking you as a servant of the gods or a chosen vessel of divine magic.</p>\n<p>A Divine Soul, with natural magnetism, is seen as a threat by some religious hierarchies. As an outsider who commands celestial power, these sorcerers can undermine the existing order by claiming a direct tie to the divine.</p>\n<p>In some cultures, only those who can claim the power of a Divine Soul may command religious power.

But different rogues steer those talents in varying directions, embodied by the rogue archetypes. Your choice of archetype is a reflection of your focusânot necessarily an indication of your chosen profession, but a description of your preferred techniques.</p>\n<h2>Arcane Trickster</h2>\n<p>Some rogues enhance their fine-honed skills of stealth and agility with magic, learning tricks of enchantment and illusion. These rogues include pickpockets and burglars, but also pranksters, mischief-makers, and a significant number of adventurers.</p>\n<h3>Arcane Trickster Features</h3>\n<p>3rd Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.ngGbuXBwO1JSr7Rp]{Spellcasting}, @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.kMPMa60hahTwYGZ9]{Mage Hand Legerdemain}</p>\n<p>9th Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.uXxqc7m5f6Dcc7QE]{Magical Ambush}</p>\n<p>13th Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.pz5QtYk5KyTwnJ5X]{Versatile Trickster}</p>\n<p>17th Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.ncvAl5XKmr8Dm6yy]{Spell Thief}</p>\n<h2>Assassin</h2>\n<p>You focus your training on the grim art of death.

You rely on your sharp eye for detail, but also on your finely honed ability to read the words and deeds of other creatures to determine their true intent. You excel at defeating creatures that hide among and prey upon ordinary folk, and your mastery of lore and your sharp eye make you well equipped to expose and end hidden evils.</p>\n<h3>Inquisitive Features</h3>\n<p>3rd Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.AGnZCKiiUQsON0GF]{Ear for Deceit}, @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.OR3LRffwjSwOZZ3A]{Eye for Detail}, @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.IE0IFeC0u5SIyy8x]{Insightful Fighting}</p>\n<p>9th Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.uoITjDK98h54MuIs]{Steady Eye}</p>\n<p>13th Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.B49L2h9bzhGcJ8qH]{Unerring Eye}</p>\n<p>17th Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.oOC6inq1p4tfmC4k]{Eye for Weakness}</p>\n<h2>Mastermind</h2>\n<p>Your focus is on people and on the influence and secrets they have.

Words are your weapons as often as knives or poison, and secrets and favors are some of your favorite treasures.</p>\n<h3>Mastermind Features</h3>\n<p>3rd Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.c3SMdZtQgNwqyyef]{Master of Intrigue}, @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.WFaDR0pRM4lIfaWl]{Master of Tactics}</p>\n<p>9th Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.MaNxycqcIoPJHySB]{Insightful Manipulator}</p>\n<p>13th Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.NghpQROk4fvhC3oI]{Misdirection}</p>\n<p>17th Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.AtHRHleBsQRtCAAv]{Soul of Deceit}</p>\n<h2>Phantom</h2>\n<p>Many rogues walk a fine line between life and death, risking their own lives and taking the lives of others. While adventuring on that line, some rogues discover a mystical connection to death itself. These rogues take knowledge from the dead and become immersed in negative energy, eventually becoming like ghosts. Thieves' guilds value them as highly effective information gatherers and spies.</p>\n<p>Many shadar-kai of the Shadowfell are masters of these macabre techniques, and some are willing to teach this path. In places like Thay in the Forgotten Realms and Karrnath in Eberron, where many necromancers practice their craft, a Phantom can become a wizard's confidant and right hand. In temples of gods of death, the Phantom might work as an agent to track down those who try to cheat death and to recover knowledge that might otherwise be lost to the grave.</p>\n<p>How did you discover this grim power? Did you sleep in a graveyard and awaken to your new abilities?

Rogues who embrace this archetype are at home in the wilderness and among barbarians and rangers, and many Scouts serve as the eyes and ears of war bands. Ambusher, spy, bounty hunter â these are just a few of the roles that Scouts assume as they range the world.</p>\n<h3>Scout Features</h3>\n<p>3rd Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.jdpl8aTVjOXCmV00]{Skirmisher}, @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.jdpl8aTVjOXCmV00]{Skirmisher}</p>\n<p>9th Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.ctQ7XIA7G8jR2R5H]{Superior Mobility}</p>\n<p>13th Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.acca8MDfsVsaOTtC]{Ambush Master}</p>\n<p>17th Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.3TlsHLUxUqs0Nmfa]{Sudden Strike}</p>\n<h2>Soulknife</h2>\n<p>Most assassins strike with physical weapons, and many burglars and spies use thieves' tools to infiltrate secure locations. In contrast, a Soulknife strikes and infiltrates with the mind, cutting through barriers both physical and psychic. These rogues discover psionic power within themselves and channel it to do their roguish work. They find easy employment as members of thieves' guilds, though they are often mistrusted by rogues who are leery of anyone using strange mind powers to conduct their business. Most governments would also be happy to employ a Soulknife as a spy.</p>\n<p>Amid the trees of ancient forests on the Material Plane and in the Feywild, some wood elves walk the path of the Soulknife, serving as silent, lethal guardians of their woods. In the endless war among the gith, a githzerai is encouraged to become a Soulknife when stealth is required against the githyanki foe.</p>\n<p>As a Soulknife, your psionic abilities might have haunted you since you were a child, only revealing their full potential as you experienced the stress of adventure. Or you might have sought out a reclusive order of psychic adepts and spent years learning how to manifest your power.</p>\n<h3>Soulknife Features</h3>\n<p>3rd Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.sszCvTdGTzcOCH8M]{Psionic Power}, @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.BuDgz0egfGdB2jEy]{Psychic Blades}</p>\n<p>9th Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.zpgDdGMxfl41TKca]{Soul Blades}</p>\n<p>13th Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.hN6l4oMynVzt3BpQ]{Psychic Veil}</p>\n<p>17th Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.LYjNOBMuE0bhbDkj]{Rend Mind}</p>\n<h2>Swashbuckler</h2>\n<p>You focus your training on the art of the blade, relying on speed, elegance, and charm in equal parts. While some warriors are brutes clad in heavy armor, your method of fighting looks almost like a performance.

You also retain all of your skill and saving throw proficiencies, in addition to gaining those of the creature.

If the creature has any legendary or lair actions, you can't use them.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When you transform, you assume the beast's hit points and Hit Dice. When you revert to your normal form, you return to the number of hit points you had before you transformed. However, if you revert as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to your normal form. For example, if you take 10 damage in animal form and have only 1 hit point left, you revert and take 9 damage. As long as the excess damage doesn't reduce your normal form to 0 hit points, you aren't knocked unconscious.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>You can't cast spells, and your ability to speak or take any action that requires hands is limited to the capabilities of your beast form.

However you acquired your fey magic, you are now a Fey Wanderer, a ranger who represents both the mortal and the fey realms. As you wander the multiverse, your joyful laughter brightens the hearts of the downtrodden, and your martial prowess strikes terror in your foes, for great is the mirth of the fey and dreadful is their fury.</p>\n<h3>Fey Wanderer Features</h3>\n<p>3rd Level:Â </p>\n<p>7th Level:Â </p>\n<p>11th Level:Â </p>\n<p>15th Level:Â </p>\n<h2>Gloom Stalker</h2>\n<p>Gloom stalkers are at home in the darkest places: deep under the earth, in gloomy alleyways, in primeval forests, and wherever else the light dims. Most folk enter such places with trepidation, but a gloom stalker ventures boldly into the darkness, seeking to ambush threats before they can reach the broader world.

as humans, the elven understanding of adulthood goes beyond physical growth to encompass worldly experience. An elf typically claims adulthood and an adult name around the age of 100 and can live to be 750 years old.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Alignment</strong></em>. Elves love freedom, variety, and self-expression, so they lean strongly toward the gentler aspects of chaos. They value and protect others' freedom as well as their own, and they are more often good than not.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Size.</strong></em> Elves range from under 5 to over 6 feet tall and have slender builds.

Instead, they meditate deeply, remaining semiconscious, for 4 hours a day. (The Common word for such meditation is \"trance.\") While meditating, you can dream after a fashion; such dreams are actually mental exercises that have become reflexive through years of practice. After resting in this way, you gain the same benefit that a human does from 8 hours of sleep.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Languages.</strong></em> You can speak, read, and write Common and Elvish. Elvish is fluid, with subtle intonations and intricate grammar. Elven literature is rich and varied, and their songs and poems are famous among other races. Many bards learn their language so they can add Elvish ballads to their repertoires.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Elf Weapon Training.</strong></em>Â You have proficiency with the longsword, shortsword, shortbow, and longbow.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Mask of the Wild.</strong></em>Â You can attempt to hide even when you are only lightly obscured by foliage, heavy rain, falling snow, mist, and other natural phenomena.</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"PHB pg. 23","activation":{"type":"","cost":0,"condition":""},"duration":{"value":null,"units":""},"target":{"value":null,"width":null,"units":"","type":""},"range":{"value":null,"long":null,"units":""},"uses":{"value":0,"max":0,"per":null,"recovery":""},"consume":{"type":"","target":null,"amount":null},"ability":null,"actionType":"","attackBonus":0,"chatFlavor":"","critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":""},"damage":{"parts":[],"versatile":""},"formula":"","save":{"ability":"","dc":null,"scaling":"spell"},"requirements":"","recharge":{"value":null,"charged":false}},"ownership":{"default":0,"THB0iiaRQeds6BDT":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.287","createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":1665342370344,"lastModifiedBy":"THB0iiaRQeds6BDT"}}

The final oath, taken when he or she reaches 3rd level, is the culmination of all the paladin's training. Some characters with this class don't consider themselves true paladins until they have reached 3rd level and made this oath. For others, the actual swearing of the oath is a formality, an official stamp on what has always been true in the paladin's heart.</p><h3>Breaking Your Oath</h3><p>A paladin tries to hold to the highest standards of conduct, but even the most virtuous paladin is fallible. Sometimes the right path proves too demanding, sometimes a situation calls for the lesser of two evils, and sometimes the heat of emotion causes a paladin to transgress his or her oath.</p><p>A paladin who has broken a vow typically seeks absolution from a cleric who shares his or her faith or from another paladin of the same order. The paladin might spend an allnight vigil in prayer as a sign of penitence, or undertake a fast or similar act of self-denial. After a rite of confession and forgiveness, the paladin starts fresh.</p><p>If a paladin willfully violates his or her oath and shows no sign of repentance, the consequences can be more serious. At the GM's discretion, an impenitent paladin might be forced to abandon this class and adopt another.</p><h2>Oath of the Ancients</h2><p>The Oath of the Ancients is as old as the race of elves and the rituals of the druids. Sometimes called fey knights, green knights, or horned knights, paladins who swear this oath cast their lot with the side of the light in the cosmic struggle against darkness because they love the beautiful and life-giving things of the world, not necessarily because they believe in principles of honor, courage, and justice. They adorn their armor and clothing with images of growing things-leaves, antlers, or flowers-to reflect their commitment to preserving life and light in the world.</p><h3>Oath of the Ancients Spells</h3><table><thead><tr><td><strong>Paladin Level</strong></td><td><strong>Spells</strong></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>3rd</td><td>Â @UUID[Compendium.cc5e.spells.mtGqim6lifXAV37b]{Ensnaring Strike}, @UUID[Compendium.cc5e.spells.6OyZdL8gH6HQoDRD]{Speak with Animals}</td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td>Â @UUID[Compendium.cc5e.spells.uZUkbl0E2ZShMmJp]{Moonbeam}, @UUID[Compendium.cc5e.spells.uk6Mk9u3JrUvrU0w]{Misty Step}</td></tr><tr><td>9th</td><td>Â @UUID[Compendium.cc5e.spells.GEzqDWNvsTmDQ4nD]{Plant Growth}, @UUID[Compendium.cc5e.spells.L5eTNtzTUVrkK8H2]{Protection from Energy}</td></tr><tr><td>13th</td><td>Â @UUID[Compendium.cc5e.spells.7r8bGVjU91d6QlCS]{Ice Storm}, @UUID[Compendium.cc5e.spells.WoVc4SVDgsPd9VvU]{Stoneskin}</td></tr><tr><td>17th</td><td>Â @UUID[Compendium.cc5e.spells.wKHoekAodXiG0Muh]{Commune with Nature}, @UUID[Compendium.cc5e.spells.gXtFNl09G1qgyTu0]{Tree Stride}</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Oath of the Ancients Features</h3><p>3rd Level:Â @UUID[Compendium.cc5e.class-classfeatures.XZrs92kp3z2sAbRa]{Channel Divinity: Natures Wrath}, @UUID[Compendium.cc5e.class-classfeatures.xbP30DjfI6thkMRk]{Channel Divinity: Turn the Faithless}</p><p>7th Level: @UUID[Compendium.cc5e.class-classfeatures.V8f1wYFNAb1SANj6]{Aura of Warding}</p><p>15th Level:Â @UUID[Compendium.cc5e.class-classfeatures.E38lsAHfudoMlj91]{Undying Sentinel}</p><p>20th Level:Â @UUID[Compendium.cc5e.class-classfeatures.bWgDUXImx0hroYbN]{Elder Champion}</p><h2>Oath of Conquest</h2><p>The Oath of Conquest calls to paladins who seek glory in battle and the subjugation of their enemies. It isnât enough for these paladins to establish order. They must crush the forces of chaos. Sometimes called knight tyrants or iron mongers, those who swear this oath gather into grim orders that serve gods or philosophies of war and well-ordered might.</p><p>Some of these paladins go so far as to consort with the powers of the Nine Hells, valuing the rule of law over the balm of mercy. The archdevil Bel, warlord of Avernus, counts many of these paladins â called hell knights â as his most ardent supporters. Hell knights cover their armor with trophies taken from fallen enemies, a grim warning to any who dare oppose them and the decrees of their lords. These knights are often most fiercely resisted by other paladins of this oath, who believe that the hell knights have wandered too far into darkness.</p><h3>Oath of Conquest Spells</h3><table><thead><tr><td><strong>Paladin Level</strong></td><td><strong>Spells</strong></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>3rd</td><td>Â @UUID[Compendium.cc5e.spells.ek12Id1UjkezJZ0c]{Armor of Agathys}, @UUID[Compendium.cc5e.spells.NEa4zDeuSITEpyYl]{Command}</td></tr><tr><td>5th</td><td>Â @UUID[Compendium.cc5e.spells.cqUKOMyFM0fy7eXb]{Hold Person}, @UUID[Compendium.cc5e.spells.cFBwsTgxtG0kGNjk]{Spiritual Weapon}</td></tr><tr><td>9th</td><td>Â @UUID[Compendium.cc5e.spells.Jsunu5k1KXsJsk7y]{Bestow Curse}, @UUID[Compendium.cc5e.spells.RsY0kj2S9XraFXkq]{Fear}</td></tr><tr><td>13th</td><td>Â @UUID[Compendium.cc5e.spells.TJf322rm9YrtoIgF]{Dominate Beast}, @UUID[Compendium.cc5e.spells.WoVc4SVDgsPd9VvU]{Stoneskin}</td></tr><tr><td>17th</td><td>Â @UUID[Compendium.cc5e.spells.qgYZ1iM8FIQI2TLO]{Cloudkill}, @UUID[Compendium.cc5e.spells.yEtovRi3mzAT2Q1l]{Dominate Person}</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Oath of Conquest Features</h3><p>3rd Level:Â @UUID[Compendium.cc5e.class-classfeatures.KYT7M9rVoHNFaSQJ]{Channel Divinity: Conquering Presence}, @UUID[Compendium.cc5e.class-classfeatures.tPiv941vuD7T9Gy0]{Channel Divinity: Guided Strike}</p><p>7th Level: @UUID[Compendium.cc5e.class-classfeatures.AaxfRwYpA7tO2PLS]{Aura of Conquest}</p><p>15th Level:Â @UUID[Compendium.cc5e.class-classfeatures.8c4LrFAdyhFPWQcD]{Scornful Rebuke}</p><p>20th Level:Â @UUID[Compendium.cc5e.class-classfeatures.xeLNVFfMsMRyV3zM]{Invincible Conqueror}</p><h2>Oath of the Crown</h2><p>The Oath of the Crown is sworn to the ideals of civilization, be it the spirit of a nation, fealty to a sovereign, or service to a deity of law and rulership.

Paladins who follow this path are known as redeemers.</p><p>While redeemers are idealists, they are no fools. Redeemers know that undead, demons, devils, and other supernatural threats can be inherently evil. Against such foes, the paladins bring the full wrath of their weapons and spells to bear.

Most monasteries practice one tradition exclusively, but a few honor the three traditions and instruct each monk according to his or her aptitude and interest. All three traditions rely on the same basic techniques, diverging as the student grows more adept. Thus, a monk need choose a tradition only upon reaching 3rd level.</p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Way of the Ascendant Dragon</h2>\n<p>The fundamental teaching of this tradition holds that by emulating dragons, a monk becomes a more integrated part of the world and its magic. By altering their spirit to resonate with draconic might, monks who follow this tradition augment their prowess in battle, bolster their allies, and can even soar through the air on draconic wings. But all this power is in service of a greater goal: achieving a spiritual unity with the essence of the Material Plane.</p>\n<h3>Way of the Ascendant Dragon Features</h3>\n<p>3rd Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.qbh8KWK3gMHscSHM]{Draconic Disciple}, @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.UmpkZakIw7biCbUK]{Breath of the Dragon}</p>\n<p>6th Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.2PjpnbQ8JTlk2MQI]{Wings Unfurled}</p>\n<p>11th Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.QIZXe6nRrQVZ4pTI]{Aspect of the Wyrm}</p>\n<p>17th Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.mitRKQfICEUxePHf]{Ascendant Aspect}</p>\n<h2>Way of the Astral Self</h2>\n<p>A monk who follows the Way of the Astral Self believes their body is an illusion.

To become a member of the Cobalt Soul is to give oneself over to a quest dedicated to unveiling life's mysteries, bringing light to the secrets of concealed evil, and guarding the most powerful and dangerous of truth from those whose unwholesome thirst for knowledge might bring death and suffering to others.</p>\n<p><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">The monks of the Cobalt Soul are the embodiment of the maxim: \"Know your enemy.\" Through tireless research, they steel themselves against the unrelenting tides of evil.

Its traditions are drawn from cultures of shapeshifters and creatures who fight with tooth and claw. These are a few of the martial techniques that have evolved into the Way of the Living Weapon.</p>\n<p>Â </p>\n<ul>\n<li>The Forged Heart is a recent path, developed by warforged exploring the potential of their constructed frames. This involves both the physical evolution of the body and harnessing the strength of steel and stone.</li>\n<li>The Nightmare Shroud is a kalashtar tradition. Rather than physically transforming, nightmare monks generate ectoplasmic projections, manifesting claws of shadow. Blending physical blows with psychic attacks, they strike fear into the mind of their enemies. A kalashtar typically surrounds themselves with the image of their quori spirit, but the shroud can take any shape.</li>\n<li>The Travelerâs Blade was developed by tribal changelings, providing the practitioner with versatile weapons that canât be taken away. A practitioner can grow bone blades or knuckle ridges, or stretch their limbs to strike a distant foe.</li>\n<li>The Weretouched techniques were developed by shifter champions of Olarune, honing the natural weapons and strengths of the shifter.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Way of the Living Weapon Features</h3>\n<p>3rd Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.gIg9JpsuZlXV1EdU]{Fists of Bone and Steel}, @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.wPaeiHlOZpT7w18v]{Martial Discipline}, @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.K9q59FIKjlevIbYT]{Mutable Strike}</p>\n<p>6th Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.K8eOIpcPbmzkzd0I]{Manifest Blow}</p>\n<p>11th Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.t7OoV7g3V5DuhsTE]{Reflexive Adaptation}</p>\n<p>17th Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.T2i2ouW2DZgEvhwR]{Perfect Form}</p>\n<h2>Way of the Long Death</h2>\n<p>Monks of the Way of the Long Death are obsessed with the meaning and mechanics of dying.

Sometimes the members of a ninja monastery are family members, forming a clan sworn to secrecy about their arts and missions. Other monasteries are more like thieves' guilds, hiring out their services to nobles, rich merchants, or anyone else who can pay their fees.

That creative work included harmonies that continue to resound through existence today, a power known as the Song of Creation. The bards of the College of Creation draw on that primeval song through dance, music, and poetry, and their teachers share this lesson: \"Before the sun and the moon, there was the Song, and its music awoke the first dawn. Its melodies so delighted the stones and trees that some of them gained a voice of their own. And now they sing too. Learn the Song, students, and you too can teach the mountains to sing and dance.\"</p>\n<p>Dwarves and gnomes often encourage their bards to become students of the Song of Creation. And among dragonborn, the Song of Creation is revered, for legends portray Bahamut and Tiamat-the greatest of dragons -as two of the song's first singers.</p>\n<h3>College of Creation Features</h3>\n<p>3rd Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.uCuGxISqMIMzty1j]{Note of Potential}, @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.NfjofE7kT8kgxncO]{Performance of Creation}</p>\n<p>6th Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.5yLisXopx0tI1QEI]{Animating Performance}</p>\n<p>14th Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.x8wwfMty65Cz5Gfk]{Creative Crescendo}</p>\n<h2>College of Eloquence</h2>\n<p>Adherents of the College of Eloquence master the art of oratory. Persuasion is regarded as a high art, and a well-reasoned, well-spoken argument often proves more powerful than objective truth. These bards wield a blend of logic and theatrical wordplay, winning over skeptics and detractors with logical arguments, and plucking at heartstrings to appeal to the emotions of entire audiences.</p>\n<h3>College of X Features</h3>\n<p>3rd Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.2eoU06HvPPgQMzuU]{Silver Tongue}, @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.pEG7pWleWyMyrkh7]{Unsettling Words}</p>\n<p>6th Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.fD9UDgQfCUoE05n8]{Unfailing Inspiration}</p>\n<p>14th Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.GTjwBw0aUkT4xfh0]{Infectious Inspiration}</p>\n<h2>College of Glamour</h2>\n<p>The College of Glamour is the home of bards who mastered their craft in the vibrant realm of the Feywild or under the tutelage of someone who dwelled there. Tutored by satyrs, eladrin, and other fey, these bards learn to use their magic to delight and captivate others.</p>\n<p>The bards of this college are regarded with a mixture of awe and fear. Their performances are the stuff of legend. These bards are so eloquent that a speech or song that one of them performs can cause captors to release the bard unharmed and can lull a furious dragon into complacency. The same magic that allows them to quell beasts can also bend minds. Villainous bards of this college can leech off a community for weeks, abusing their magic to turn their hosts into thralls. Heroic bards of this college instead use this power to gladden the downtrodden and undermine oppressors.</p>\n<h3>College of Glamour Features</h3>\n<p>3rd Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.0hnzi8bQaEeipQoy]{Mantle of Inspiration}, @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.4ueDFzSWkaUYs3Rj]{Enthralling Performance}</p>\n<p>6th Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.vZzFjlvZ7a1mpOFM]{Mantle of Mejesty}</p>\n<p>14th Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.Vdu1C5abMeggXmCr]{Unbreakable Majesty}</p>\n<h2>College of Lore</h2>\n<p>Bards of the College of Lore know something about most things, collecting bits of knowledge from sources as diverse as scholarly tomes and peasant tales. Whether singing folk ballads in taverns or elaborate compositions in royal courts, these bards use their gifts to hold audiences spellbound. When the applause dies down, the audience members might find themselves questioning everything they held to be true, from their faith in the priesthood of the local temple to their loyalty to the king.</p>\n<p>The loyalty of these bards lies in the pursuit of beauty and truth, not in fealty to a monarch or following the tenets of a deity. A noble who keeps such a bard as a herald or advisor knows that the bard would rather be honest than politic.</p>\n<p>The college's members gather in libraries and sometimes in actual colleges, complete with classrooms and dormitories, to share their lore with one another. They also meet at festivals or affairs of state, where they can expose corruption, unravel lies, and poke fun at self-important figures of authority.</p>\n<h3>College of Lore Features</h3>\n<p>3rd Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.0sDKrWkSs00DjNw7]{Bonus Proficiencies}, @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.XD4eRx2NoHXb6och]{Cutting Words}</p>\n<p>6th Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.Ql14GFlfucTKZQ9k]{Additional Magical Secrets}</p>\n<p>14th Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.XGdQoxLFmQc6b3v4]{Peerless Skill}</p>\n<h2>College of Spirits</h2>\n<p>Bards of the College of Spirits seek tales with inherent power-be they legends, histories, or fictions-and bring their subjects to life. Using occult trappings, these bards conjure spiritual embodiments of powerful forces to change the world once more. Such spirits are capricious, though, and what a bard summons isn't always entirely under their control.</p>\n<h3>College of Spirits Features</h3>\n<p>3rd Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.vZHk8waoBQPAUVo9]{Guiding Whispers}, @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.JpQ65rbDM88xnu6z]{Spiritual Focus}, @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.mVpS2x2bAGEG6t0q]{Tales From Beyond}</p>\n<p>6th Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.7aoENziEYigVSfUg]{Spirit Session}, Spiritual Focus Upgrade</p>\n<p>14th Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.NmWfOv4BrGycvq67]{Mystical Connection}</p>\n<h2>College of Swords</h2>\n<p>Bards of the College of Swords are called blades, and they entertain through daring feats of weapon prowess. Blades perform stunts such as sword swallowing, knife throwing and juggling, and mock combats. Though they use their weapons to entertain, they are also highly trained and skilled warriors in their own right.</p>\n<p>Their talent with weapons inspires many blades to lead double lives. One blade might use a circus troupe as cover for nefarious deeds such as assassination, robbery, and blackmail. Other blades strike at the wicked, bringing justice to bear against the cruel and powerful. Most troupes are happy to accept a bladeâs talent for the excitement it adds to a performance, but few entertainers fully trust a blade in their ranks.</p>\n<p>Blades who abandon their lives as entertainers have often run into trouble that makes maintaining their secret activities impossible. A blade caught stealing or engaging in vigilante justice is too great a liability for most troupes. With their weapon skills and magic, these blades either take up work as enforcers for thievesâ guilds or strike out on their own as adventurers.</p>\n<h3>College of Swords Features</h3>\n<p>3rd Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.JNvO0H3spOe3UNkP]{Bonus Proficiencies}, @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.VQ1XS6TolBFf91nb]{Fighting Style}, @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.X3YPHls2BihNu67E]{Blade Flourish}</p>\n<p>6th Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.FUOhXb6A3XTuCCdS]{Extra Attack}</p>\n<p>14th Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.4xJ47OepM01CIOqv]{Master's Flourish}</p>\n<h2>College of Valor</h2>\n<p>Bards of the College of Valor are daring skalds whose tales keep alive the memory of the great heroes of the past, and thereby inspire a new generation of heroes. These bards gather in mead halls or around great bonfires to sing the deeds of the mighty, both past and present. They travel the land to witness great events firsthand and to ensure that the memory of those events doesn't pass from the world. With their songs, they inspire others to reach the same heights of accomplishment as the heroes of old.</p>\n<h3>College of Valor Features</h3>\n<p>3rd Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.P0T68KZhcWOqCiKh]{Bonus Proficiencies}, @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.zXNrilr5EuVzeIEZ]{Combat Inspiration}</p>\n<p>6th Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.FUOhXb6A3XTuCCdS]{Extra Attack}</p>\n<p>14th Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.RqRXLIfJcKNGmeEn]{Battle Magic}</p>\n<h2>College of Whispers</h2>\n<p>Most folk are happy to welcome a bard into their midst. Bards of the College of Whispers use this to their advantage. They appear to be like any other bard, sharing news, singing songs, and telling tales to the audiences they gather. In truth, the College of Whispers teaches its students that they are wolves among sheep. These bards use their knowledge and magic to uncover secrets and turn them against others through extortion and threats.</p>\n<p>Many other bards hate the College of Whispers, viewing it as a parasite that uses the bardsâ reputation to acquire wealth and power. For this reason, these bards rarely reveal their true nature unless they must. They typically claim to follow some other college, or keep their true nature secret in order to better infiltrate and exploit royal courts and other settings of power.</p>\n<h3>College of Whispers Features</h3>\n<p>3rd Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.ryWVMDBGSoXLNyin]{Psychic Blades}, @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.Olu8xwa9SF52ReWf]{Words of Terror}</p>\n<p>6th Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.05CIQNSkwoPb1wig]{Mantle of Whispers}</p>\n<p>14th Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.GIWXd0z6fcsuq1UM]{Shadow Lore}</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Player's Handbook","identifier":"bard","levels":1,"hitDice":"d8","hitDiceUsed":0,"advancement":[{"_id":"tz045jh2zbloe6ny","type":"HitPoints","configuration":{},"value":{}},{"_id":"mk29wzhb7tjt52t4","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.cc5e.class-classfeatures.J9atUbfPf8PWqLqk","Compendium.cc5e.class-classfeatures.e1N6OoGWZIvJBGe7"],"optional":false},"value":{},"level":1,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"un4b5ibmkekq4nry","type":"ScaleValue","configuration":{"identifier":"inspiration","type":"dice","distance":{"units":""},"scale":{"1":{"n":null,"die":6},"5":{"n":null,"die":8},"10":{"n":null,"die":10},"15":{"n":null,"die":12}}},"value":{},"title":"Bardic Inspiration Die","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"2di9szmxm7okuldy","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.cc5e.class-classfeatures.R55rtmh1CYLByNFS","Compendium.cc5e.class-classfeatures.AvkeJaOFRPcEesHD"],"optional":false},"value":{},"level":2,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"7e3m7dsybqr580rx","type":"ScaleValue","configuration":{"identifier":"song-of-rest","type":"dice","distance":{"units":""},"scale":{"2":{"n":null,"die":6},"10":{"n":null,"die":8},"13":{"n":null,"die":10},"17":{"n":null,"die":12}}},"value":{},"title":"Song of Rest Die","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"buwwv46sh4uvdxz8","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.cc5e.class-classfeatures.6HH8afl0DP1sv0be","Compendium.cc5e.class-classfeatures.oduHkWU6WR0h3X3Y"],"optional":false},"value":{},"level":3,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"q8eq1rqtcbw2o2y7","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.cc5e.class-classfeatures.1PnZtOyQDQer5iVu"],"optional":false},"value":{},"level":5,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"ku2e24mpahlu5djm","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.cc5e.class-classfeatures.fBel4NkQu448u3lo"],"optional":false},"value":{},"level":6,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"cxscqm2h034v1gv4","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.cc5e.class-classfeatures.w0TFSuFFFJHc8hN9"],"optional":false},"value":{},"level":10,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"4hyfox4cl5pnrio0","type":"ScaleValue","configuration":{"identifier":"expertise","type":"number","distance":{"units":""},"scale":{"3":{"value":2},"10":{"value":4}}},"value":{},"title":"Expertise","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"hqc03y5n1qpzjwjr","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.cc5e.class-classfeatures.9xnLxdzaaiLMRtxs"],"optional":false},"value":{},"level":20,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"n2wjspuffarrij5e","type":"ScaleValue","configuration":{"identifier":"magical-secrets","type":"number","distance":{"units":""},"scale":{"10":{"value":2},"14":{"value":4},"18":{"value":6}}},"value":{},"title":"Magical Secrets Spells Known","icon":"","classRestriction":""}],"saves":["dex","cha"],"skills":{"number":3,"choices":["acr","ani","arc","ath","dec","his","ins","itm","inv","med","nat","prc","per","prf","rel","slt","ste","sur"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"full","ability":"cha"},"subclass":"","damage":{"parts":[]},"critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":null}},"ownership":{"default":0,"THB0iiaRQeds6BDT":3},"_stats":{"systemId":"dnd5e","systemVersion":"2.0.3","coreVersion":"10.286","createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":1664318031856,"lastModifiedBy":"THB0iiaRQeds6BDT"}}

Tempest gods send their clerics to inspire fear in the common folk, either to keep those folk on the path of righteousness or to encourage them to offer sacrifices of propitiation to ward off divine wrath.</p>\n<h3>Tempest Domain Spells</h3>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Cleric Level</strong></td>\n<td><strong>Spells</strong></td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1st</td>\n<td>@Compendium[cc5e.spells.rbIMmoQaKLspHJnS]{Fog Cloud}, @Compendium[cc5e.spells.pfhP6otgZflTiwNH]{Thunderwave}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3rd</td>\n<td>@Compendium[cc5e.spells.BHURnXhALF0ifB3p]{Gust of Wind}, @Compendium[cc5e.spells.iB8C3aPLYbfgvFQs]{Shatter}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5th</td>\n<td>@Compendium[cc5e.spells.K8lh84b37BXvoDsq]{Call Lightning}, @Compendium[cc5e.spells.2VL4RvrHgWkNSJHz]{Sleet Storm}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>7th</td>\n<td>@Compendium[cc5e.spells.MTcdJHetcLORaL1m]{Control Water}, @Compendium[cc5e.spells.7r8bGVjU91d6QlCS]{Ice Storm}</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>9th</td>\n<td>@Compendium[cc5e.spells.tjLxAo6133kmPIPC]{Destructive Wave}, @Compendium[cc5e.spells.dDxyGK16KXAukrbf]{Insect Plague}</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h3>Tempest Domain Features</h3>\n<p>1st Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.kFYfcVyoUJTPWBww]{Bonus Proficiencies}, @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.XwdzWeRE9VxG2pAg]{Wrath of the Storm}</p>\n<p>2nd Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.nbQytLPfoXLenUUw]{Channel Divinity: Destructive Wrath}</p>\n<p>6th Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.WEoRpw7QHHpIk10C]{Thunderous Strike}</p>\n<p>8th Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.mJ0kxJpVjBqPc6RE]{Divine Strike}</p>\n<p>17th Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.VFrW2GtjmOujf5zD]{Stormborn}</p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Player's Handbook","identifier":"tempest-domain","classIdentifier":"cleric","advancement":[{"_id":"c0o4trgb8ssv54db","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.cc5e.class-classfeatures.kFYfcVyoUJTPWBww","Compendium.cc5e.class-classfeatures.XwdzWeRE9VxG2pAg"],"optional":false},"value":{},"level":1,"title":"Domain Features","icon":""},{"_id":"9tk26eorr9acykhk","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.cc5e.class-classfeatures.nbQytLPfoXLenUUw"],"optional":false},"value":{},"level":2,"title":"Domain Features","icon":""},{"_id":"mhogfp3hgwr58z4t","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.cc5e.class-classfeatures.WEoRpw7QHHpIk10C"],"optional":false},"value":{},"level":6,"title":"Domain Features","icon":""},{"_id":"p88lem91c7ims1oq","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.cc5e.class-classfeatures.mJ0kxJpVjBqPc6RE"],"optional":false},"value":{},"level":8,"title":"Domain Features","icon":""},{"_id":"wsws60wm36oyazfc","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.cc5e.class-classfeatures.VFrW2GtjmOujf5zD"],"optional":false},"value":{},"level":17,"title":"Domain Features","icon":""},{"_id":"v5wk2pb9dq4t4u32","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.cc5e.spells.rbIMmoQaKLspHJnS","Compendium.cc5e.spells.pfhP6otgZflTiwNH"],"optional":false},"value":{},"level":1,"title":"Domain Spells","icon":""},{"_id":"i0i2u0nfd6ylzod6","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.cc5e.spells.BHURnXhALF0ifB3p","Compendium.cc5e.spells.iB8C3aPLYbfgvFQs"],"optional":false},"value":{},"level":3,"title":"Domain Spells","icon":""},{"_id":"h5jcvuujebe7rheo","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.cc5e.spells.K8lh84b37BXvoDsq","Compendium.cc5e.spells.2VL4RvrHgWkNSJHz"],"optional":false},"value":{},"level":5,"title":"Domain Spells","icon":""},{"_id":"738adhjnclqtsi1v","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.cc5e.spells.MTcdJHetcLORaL1m","Compendium.cc5e.spells.7r8bGVjU91d6QlCS"],"optional":false},"value":{},"level":7,"title":"Domain Spells","icon":""},{"_id":"b03wc8hmu5r0613j","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":["Compendium.cc5e.spells.tjLxAo6133kmPIPC","Compendium.cc5e.spells.dDxyGK16KXAukrbf"],"optional":false},"value":{},"level":9,"title":"Domain Spells","icon":""},{"_id":"dra0i0teovmmmz4t","type":"ScaleValue","configuration":{"identifier":"divine-strike","type":"dice","distance":{"units":""},"scale":{"8":{"n":1,"die":8},"14":{"n":2,"die":8}}},"value":{},"title":"Divine Strike Damage","icon":""}],"spellcasting":{"progression":"none","ability":""}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"THB0iiaRQeds6BDT":3},"flags":{"cf":{"id":"temp_1yur439fshn","path":"Class Features#/CF_SEP/Cleric","color":"#000000"},"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.world.temp.rj69JJtPEddBcJIJ"}}}

Some Swarmkeepers are outcasts or hermits, keeping to themselves and their attendant swarms rather than dealing with the discomfort of others. Other Swarmkeepers enjoy building vibrant communities that work for the mutual benefit of all those they consider part of their swarm.</p>\n<h3>Swarmkeeper Features</h3>\n<p>3rd Level:Â </p>\n<p>5th Level:Â </p>\n<p>7th Level:Â </p>\n<p>11th Level:Â </p>\n<p>15th Level:Â </p>","chat":"","unidentified":""},"source":"Ranger, Revised - Unearthed Arcana","identifier":"ranger","levels":1,"hitDice":"d10","hitDiceUsed":0,"advancement":[{"_id":"4mocjr5953p6kxq6","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":[]},"value":{},"level":1,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"grh60hysbhygcqsn","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":[]},"value":{},"level":2,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"6jqpxc2xy7vr88qg","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":[]},"value":{},"level":3,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"7262aq2micmp2ev4","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":[]},"value":{},"level":5,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"85k9uri6zs252jrk","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":[]},"value":{},"level":8,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"itws1fpeqhk8gatx","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":[]},"value":{},"level":10,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"wr2ixz0z21sklajn","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":[]},"value":{},"level":14,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"gxvuyhdscr0u8kjj","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":[]},"value":{},"level":18,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"e0210lyzfoffum4w","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":[]},"value":{},"level":20,"title":"Features","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"dme7gayrvi7dvi4d","type":"HitPoints","configuration":{},"value":{},"title":"","icon":"","classRestriction":""},{"_id":"uafjp7gcod74acp1","type":"ItemGrant","configuration":{"items":[],"optional":true},"value":{},"level":3,"title":"Ranger Conclave","icon":"modules/cc5e/icons/Classes%20and%20Class%20Features/Classes/ranger.png","classRestriction":""}],"saves":["str","dex"],"skills":{"number":3,"choices":["ani","ath","ins","inv","nat","prc","ste","sur"],"value":[]},"spellcasting":{"progression":"half","ability":"wis"},"subclass":"","damage":{"parts":[]},"critical":{"threshold":null,"damage":null}},"effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"THB0iiaRQeds6BDT":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"Compendium.dnd5e.classes.VkRQ7glQvTWWiOCS"},"cf":{"id":"temp_d04ffq0n8d4","path":"Classes","color":"#000000"}}}

Druids often use such plants as part of a spellcasting focus, incorporating lengths of oak or yew or sprigs of mistletoe.</p>\n<p>Similarly, a druid uses such woods to make other objects, such as weapons and shields. Yew is associated with death and rebirth, so weapon handles for scimitars or sickles might be fashioned from it. Ash is associated with life and oak with strength. These woods make excellent hafts or whole weapons, such as clubs or quarterstaffs, as well as shields. Alder is associated with air, and it might be used for thrown weapons, such as darts or javelins.</p>\n<p>Druids from regions that lack the plants described here have chosen other plants to take on similar uses. For instance, a druid of a desert region might value the yucca tree and cactus plants.</p>\n<h3>Druids and the Gods</h3>\n<p>Some druids venerate the forces of nature themselves, but most druids are devoted to one of the many nature deities worshiped in the multiverse (the lists of gods in <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"dnd5e.rules\" data-id=\"2JNtWRo7wMq08bXn\"> appendix PH-B</a> include many such deities). The worship of these deities is often considered a more ancient tradition than the faiths of clerics and urbanized peoples.</p>\n<h1>Druid Circles</h1>\n<h2>Circle of Dreams</h2>\n<p>Druids who are members of the Circle of Dreams hail from regions that have strong ties to the Feywild and its dreamlike realms. The druidsâ guardianship of the natural world makes for a natural alliance between them and good-aligned fey. These druids seek to fill the world with dreamy wonder. Their magic mends wounds and brings joy to downcast hearts, and the realms they protect are gleaming, fruitful places, where dream and reality blur together and where the weary can find rest.</p>\n<h3>Circle of Dreams Features</h3>\n<p>2nd Level: Â @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.d4EUVL6VfJzoXVsG]{Balm of the Summer Court}</p>\n<p>6th Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.XAvYZqzaesVpgKUJ]{Hearth of Moonlight and Shadow}</p>\n<p>10th Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.BEYYAjfqRe2pxWPD]{Hidden Paths}</p>\n<p>14th Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.uPXJ11ty5RNdThh5]{Walker in Dreams}</p>\n<h2>Circle of the Land</h2>\n<p>The Circle of the Land is made up of mystics and sages who safeguard ancient knowledge and rites through a vast oral tradition. These druids meet within sacred circles of trees or standing stones to whisper primal secrets in Druidic. The circle's wisest members preside as the chief priests of communities that hold to the Old Faith and serve as advisors to the rulers of those folk. As a member of this circle, your magic is influenced by the land where you were initiated into the circle's mysterious rites.</p>\n<h3>Circle of the Land Features</h3>\n<p>2nd Level: <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"dnd5e.classfeatures\" data-id=\"lT8GsPOPgRzDC3QJ\"> Bonus Cantrip</a> <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"dnd5e.classfeatures\" data-id=\"wKdRtFsvGfMKQHLY\"> Natural Recovery</a></p>\n<p>3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th Level: <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"dnd5e.classfeatures\" data-id=\"YiK59gWSlcQ6Mbdz\"> Circle Spells</a></p>\n<p>6th Level: <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"dnd5e.classfeatures\" data-id=\"3FB25qKxmkmxcxuC\"> Land's Stride</a></p>\n<p>10th Level: <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"dnd5e.classfeatures\" data-id=\"OTvrJSJSUgAwXrWX\"> Nature's Ward</a></p>\n<p>14th Level: <a class=\"entity-link\" draggable=\"true\" data-pack=\"dnd5e.classfeatures\" data-id=\"EuX1kJNIw1F68yus\"> Nature's Sanctuary</a></p>\n<h2>Circle of the Moon</h2>\n<p>Druids of the Circle of the Moon are fierce guardians of the wilds. Their order gathers under the full moon to share news and trade warnings. They haunt the deepest parts of the wilderness, where they might go for weeks on end before crossing paths with another humanoid creature, let alone another druid.</p>\n<p>Changeable as the moon, a druid of this circle might prowl as a great cat one night, soar over the treetops as an eagle the next day, and crash through the undergrowth in bear form to drive off a trespassing monster.

These druids recognize that all living things play a role in the natural world, yet they focus on protecting animals and fey creatures that have difficulty defending themselves. Shepherds, as they are known, see such creatures as their charges. They ward off monsters that threaten them, rebuke hunters who kill more prey than necessary, and prevent civilization from encroaching on rare animal habitats and on sites sacred to the fey.</p>\n<p>Many of these druids are happiest far from cities and towns, content to spend their days in the company of animals and the fey creatures of the wilds. Members of this circle become adventurers to oppose forces that threaten their charges or to seek knowledge and power that will help them safeguard their charges better. Wherever these druids go, the spirits of the wilderness are with them.</p>\n<h3>Circle of the Shepherd Features</h3>\n<p>2nd Level: Â @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.XvAVmgBkMT0QRP8B]{Speech of the Woods}, @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.Yh5kmmUX1rQbdbwR]{Spirit Totem}</p>\n<p>6th Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.O8B5E6tkLRilo52b]{Mighty Summoner}</p>\n<p>10th Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.yDqGYvyGKc8M0mMC]{Guardian Spirit}</p>\n<p>14th Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.knzRHsrmakr41xqf]{Faithful Summons}</p>\n<h2>Circle of Spores</h2>\n<p>Druids of the Circle of Spores find beauty in decay. They see within mold and other fungi the ability to transform lifeless material into abundant, albeit somewhat strange, life. These druids believe that life and death are parts of a grand cycle, with one leading to the other and then back again. Death isn't the end of life, but instead a change of state that sees life shift into a new form.</p>\n<p>Druids of this circle have a complex relationship with the undead. They see nothing inherently wrong with undeath, which they consider to be a companion to life and death. But these druids believe that the natural cycle is healthiest when each segment of it is vibrant and changing. Undead that seek to replace all life with undeath, or that try to avoid passing to a final rest, violate the cycle and must be thwarted.</p>\n<h3>Circle of Spores Features</h3>\n<p>2nd Level: Â @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.RlrAJBzLlbCbKt5G]{Halo of Spores}, @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.aXM6qHzWDpY0ECBv]{Symbiotic Entity}</p>\n<p>3rd, 5th, 7th, 9th Level: Circle Spells</p>\n<p>6th Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.QkOcsnfDyKYELN3L]{Fungal Infestation}</p>\n<p>10th Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.opGeQ5sos5QoPZJC]{Spreading Spores}</p>\n<p>14th Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.oTytpuW1n8HloQWI]{Fungal Body}</p>\n<h2>Circle of Stars</h2>\n<p>The Circle of Stars allows druids to draw on the power of starlight. These druids have tracked heavenly patterns since time immemorial, discovering secrets hidden amid the constellations. By revealing and understanding these secrets, the Circle of the Stars seeks to harness the powers of the cosmos.</p>\n<p>Many druids of this circle keep records of the constellations and the stars' effects on the world. Some groups document these observations at megalithic sites, which serve as enigmatic libraries of lore.

Over the centuries, the methods of these elf archers have been learned by members of other races who can also balance arcane aptitude with archery.</p>\n<h3>Arcane Archer Features</h3>\n<p>3rd Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.pz6FAhjSXMuKMHAi]{Arcane Archer Lore}, @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.xINlIsmdQ1WpZxlI]{Arcane Shot}</p>\n<p>7th Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.NdBcNgnTGClnPZri]{Magic Arrow}, @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.j5c4NZSh3uSFHLpv]{Curving Shot}, @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.xINlIsmdQ1WpZxlI]{Arcane Shot (3 options)}</p>\n<p>10th Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.xINlIsmdQ1WpZxlI]{Arcane Shot (4 options)}</p>\n<p>15th Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.N7oD4YxeUvtjJUPC]{Ever-Ready Shot}, @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.xINlIsmdQ1WpZxlI]{Arcane Shot (5 options)}</p>\n<p>18th Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.xINlIsmdQ1WpZxlI]{Arcane Shot (6 options, improved shots)}</p>\n<h2>Banneret</h2>\n<p>A banneret is a knight who inspires greatness in others by committing brave deeds in battle. The mere presence of one in a hamlet is enough to cause some orcs and bandits to seek easier prey. A lone banneret is a skilled warrior, but a banneret leading a band of allies can transform even the most poorly equipped militia into a ferocious war band.</p>\n<p>A banneret prefers to lead through deeds, not words. As a banneret spearheads an attack, their actions can awaken reserves of courage and conviction in allies that they never suspected they had.</p>\n<p>Banneret serves as the generic name for the Purple Dragon Knight archetype if you use it in campaign settings other than the Forgotten Realms or to model warlords other than Purple Dragon Knights.</p>\n<h3>Banneret Features</h3>\n<p>3rd Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.wB5HwaUOPn7wgo6u]{Rallying Cry}</p>\n<p>7th Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.k1TTmfAsEbQwnvta]{Royal Envoy}</p>\n<p>10th Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.TvuMviH7mI5XCrLD]{Inspiring Surge}</p>\n<p>15th Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.3pvUnrH9nEYYr04z]{Bulwark}</p>\n<p>18th Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.TvuMviH7mI5XCrLD]{Inspiring Surge (2 allies)}</p>\n<h2>Battle Master</h2>\n<p>Those who emulate the archetypal Battle Master employ martial techniques passed down through generations. To a Battle Master, combat is an academic field, sometimes including subjects beyond battle such as weaponsmithing and calligraphy. Not every fighter absorbs the lessons of history, theory, and artistry that are reflected in the Battle Master archetype, but those who do are well-rounded fighters of great skill and knowledge.</p>\n<h3>Battle Master Features</h3>\n<p>3rd Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.TrCAuMSGc1hB3Htk]{Combat Superiority}, @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.UdtHpicv9boORm7s]{Student of War}</p>\n<p>7th Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.E0PnlZC1kFMOyXwS]{Know Your Enemy}</p>\n<p>10th Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.1IHrIAYXosvH7aMl]{Improved Combat Superiority (d10)}</p>\n<p>15th Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.QBXMHRWuoVDsyZWb]{Relentless}</p>\n<p>18th Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.1IHrIAYXosvH7aMl]{Improved Combat Superiority (d12)}</p>\n<h2>Cavalier</h2>\n<p>The archetypal cavalier excels at mounted combat. Usually born among the nobility and raised at court, a cavalier is equally at home leading a cavalry charge or exchanging repartee at a state dinner. Cavaliers also learn how to guard those in their charge from harm, often serving as the protectors of their superiors and of the weak. Compelled to right wrongs or earn prestige, many of these fighters leave their lives of comfort to embark on glorious adventure.</p>\n<h3>Cavalier Features</h3>\n<p>3rd Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.u5hyrUf5UsW4gdBm]{Bonus Proficiency (Cavalier)}, @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.Mh9qLuRzc3AXemWG]{Born to the Saddle}, @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.ocWyHPFPb2D7yNQP]{Unwavering Mark}</p>\n<p>7th Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.Auox2JwXXBqMmi0X]{Warding Maneuver}</p>\n<p>10th Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.Bxu3h0SjLjBY1UDF]{Hold the Line}</p>\n<p>15th Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.tCu2mn6jVu6iSwnH]{Ferocious Charger}</p>\n<p>18th Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.w6Corpj7st3ESF5Q]{Vigilant Defender}</p>\n<h2>Champion</h2>\n<p>The archetypal Champion focuses on the development of raw physical power honed to deadly perfection.

Eldritch Knights use magical techniques similar to those practiced by wizards. They focus their study on two of the eight schools of magic: abjuration and evocation. Abjuration spells grant an Eldritch Knight additional protection in battle, and evocation spells deal damage to many foes at once, extending the fighter's reach in combat. These knights learn a comparatively small number of spells, committing them to memory instead of keeping them in a spellbook.</p>\n<h3>Eldrich Knight Features</h3>\n<p>3rd Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.VtGAKQNbYW6UiUcR]{Spellcasting}, @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.6iNMFpuKAsT8C9IR]{Weapon Bond}</p>\n<p>7th Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.hRkyEFlRKRrm8csR]{War Magic}</p>\n<p>10th Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.mDaeeY48pELtTq6k]{Eldritch Strike}</p>\n<p>15th Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.httruL4tC7lBkodx]{Arcane Charge}</p>\n<p>18th Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.37OS04adpknWXVnm]{Improved War Magic}</p>\n<h2 style=\"border-bottom:1px solid var(--color-underline-header)\">Gunslinger</h2>\n<p>Most warriors and combat specialists spend their years perfecting the classic arts of swordplay, archery, or pole arm tactics. Whether duelist or infantry, martial weapons were seemingly perfected long ago, and the true challenge is to master them. However, some minds couldnât stop with the innovation of the crossbow.

You might find other spells during your adventures. You could discover a spell recorded on a scroll in an evil wizard's chest, for example, or in a dusty tome in an ancient library.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Copying a Spell into the Book.</strong></em> When you find a wizard spell of 1st level or higher, you can add it to your spellbook if it is of a spell level you can prepare and if you can spare the time to decipher and copy it.</p>\n<p>Copying that spell into your spellbook involves reproducing the basic form of the spell, then deciphering the unique system of notation used by the wizard who wrote it. You must practice the spell until you understand the sounds or gestures required, then transcribe it into your spellbook using your own notation.</p>\n<p>For each level of the spell, the process takes 2 hours and costs 50 gp. The cost represents material components you expend as you experiment with the spell to master it, as well as the fine inks you need to record it. Once you have spent this time and money, you can prepare the spell just like your other spells.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Replacing the Book.</strong></em> You can copy a spell from your own spellbook into another bookâfor example, if you want to make a backup copy of your spellbook. This is just like copying a new spell into your spellbook, but faster and easier, since you understand your own notation and already know how to cast the spell. You need spend only 1 hour and 10 gp for each level of the copied spell.</p>\n<p>If you lose your spellbook, you can use the same procedure to transcribe the spells that you have prepared into a new spellbook. Filling out the remainder of your spellbook requires you to find new spells to do so, as normal. For this reason, many wizards keep backup spellbooks in a safe place.</p>\n<p><em><strong>The Book's Appearance.</strong></em> Your spellbook is a unique compilation of spells, with its own decorative flourishes and margin notes. It might be a plain, functional leather volume that you received as a gift from your master, a finely bound gilt-edged tome you found in an ancient library, or even a loose collection of notes scrounged together after you lost your previous spellbook in a mishap.</p>\n<h1>Arcane Traditions</h1>\n<p>The study of wizardry is ancient, stretching back to the earliest mortal discoveries of magic. It is firmly established in fantasy gaming worlds, with various traditions dedicated to its complex study.</p>\n<p>The most common arcane traditions in the multiverse revolve around the schools of magic. Wizards through the ages have cataloged thousands of spells, grouping them into eight categories called schools. In some places, these traditions are literally schools. In other institutions, the schools are more like academic departments, with rival faculties competing for students and funding. Even wizards who train apprentices in the solitude of their own towers use the division of magic into schools as a learning device, since the spells of each school require mastery of different techniques.</p>\n<h2>School of Abjuration</h2>\n<p>The School of Abjuration emphasizes magic that blocks, banishes, or protects. Detractors of this school say that its tradition is about denial, negation rather than positive assertion. You understand, however, that ending harmful effects, protecting the weak, and banishing evil influences is anything but a philosophical void. It is a proud and respected vocation.</p>\n<p>Called abjurers, members of this school are sought when baleful spirits require exorcism, when important locations must be guarded against magical spying, and when portals to other planes of existence must be closed.</p>\n<h3>School of Abjuration Features</h3>\n<p>2nd Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.MmOikFVO5iCEvsRP]{Abjuration Savant}, @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.cfIzHFfBWLoFlq3U]{Arcane Ward}</p>\n<p>6th Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.SzaeAc2qhHPyTI1J]{Projected Ward}</p>\n<p>10th Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.tscBrE9hi5A3VgXI]{Improved Abjuration}</p>\n<p>14th Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.PQjR8gYkXEviJD2E]{Spell Resistance}</p>\n<h2>School of Bladesinging</h2>\n<p>Bladesingers master a tradition of wizardry that incorporates swordplay and dance. Originally created by elves, this tradition has been adopted by non-elf practitioners, who honor and expand on the elven ways.</p>\n<p>In combat, a bladesinger uses a series of intricate, elegant maneuvers that fend off harm and allow the bladesinger to channel magic into devastating attacks and a cunning defense. Many who have observed a bladesinger at work remember the display as one of the more beautiful experiences in their life, a glorious dance accompanied by a singing blade.</p>\n<h3>School of Bladesinging Features</h3>\n<p>2nd Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.2dQxRN2CpT1Fw7Yy]{Training in War and Song}, @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.kQgYNozDsmzNaGYf]{Bladesong}</p>\n<p>6th Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.PES2n97hC8vVaUKb]{Extra Attack}</p>\n<p>10th Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.nc12cAiqYoEGqZCx]{Song of Defense}</p>\n<p>14th Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.47nSnJsO5UIieoKd]{Song of Victory}</p>\n<h2>School of Chronurgy</h2>\n<p>Focusing on the manipulation of time, those who follow the Chronurgy tradition learn to alter the pace of reality to their liking.

As a diviner, you strive to part the veils of space, time, and consciousness so that you can see clearly. You work to master spells of discernment, remote viewing, supernatural knowledge, and foresight.</p>\n<h3>School of Divination Features</h3>\n<p>2nd Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.OIpIsEGOkx32eoFM]{Divination Savant}, @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.fMCf4faoxqAYkW5U]{Portent}</p>\n<p>6th Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.uMqPqnb34FZfLK08]{Expert Divination}</p>\n<p>10th Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.fYkaiL5QJ47NIg2W]{The Third Eye}</p>\n<p>14th Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.DcC7he8Q4xN4qnaM]{Greater Portent}</p>\n<h2>School of Enchantment</h2>\n<p>As a member of the School of Enchantment, you have honed your ability to magically entrance and beguile other people and monsters.

Some evokers find employment in military forces, serving as artillery to blast enemy armies from afar. Others use their spectacular power to protect the weak, while some seek their own gain as bandits, adventurers, or aspiring tyrants.</p>\n<h3>School of Evocation Features</h3>\n<p>2nd Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.RlWoUrubXMrZVsNu]{Evocation Savant}, @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.atSOGKeeZ3u4dDw3]{Sculpt Spells}</p>\n<p>6th Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.ScX4xhCwhflM5ds9]{Potent Cantrip}</p>\n<p>10th Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.IoXrrnozGWECmLOP]{Empowered Evocation}</p>\n<p>14th Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.kbyWkvNOqstjLsUr]{Overchannel}</p>\n<h2>School of Graviturgy</h2>\n<p>Understanding and mastering the forces that draw bodies of matter together or drive them apart, the students of the Graviturgy arcane tradition learn to further bend and manipulate the violent energy of gravity to their benefit, and the terrible detriment of their enemies.</p>\n<h3>School of Graviturgy Features</h3>\n<p>2nd Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.WaBR7ONDy494BBIb]{Adjust Density}</p>\n<p>6th Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.0rDGlwsRWxc1faQE]{Gravity Well}</p>\n<p>10th Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.FnIkxVenx5x24ml7]{Violent Attraction}</p>\n<p>14th Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.OdMuoTZTySpwynJ4]{Event Horizon}</p>\n<h2>School of Illusion</h2>\n<p>You focus your studies on magic that dazzles the senses, befuddles the mind, and tricks even the wisest folk. Your magic is subtle, but the illusions crafted by your keen mind make the impossible seem real. Some illusionists â including many gnome wizards â are benign tricksters who use their spells to entertain. Others are more sinister masters of deception, using their illusions to frighten and fool others for their personal gain.</p>\n<h3>School of Illusion Features</h3>\n<p>2nd Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.Hft3Pf0WVRvJWILu]{Illusion Savant}, @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.gNNw8mHxKBFtgjzy]{Improved Minor Illusion}</p>\n<p>6th Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.NOmSwRMriO215jWw]{Malleable Illusions}</p>\n<p>10th Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.4USQpNGefWU4vwOE]{Illusory Self}</p>\n<p>14th Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.ezhg2HdoxeFuneWr]{Illusory Reality}</p>\n<h2>School of Necromancy</h2>\n<p>The School of Necromancy explores the cosmic forces of life, death, and undeath. As you focus your studies in this tradition, you learn to manipulate the energy that animates all living things. As you progress, you learn to sap the life force from a creature as your magic destroys its body, transforming that vital energy into magical power you can manipulate.</p>\n<p>Most people see necromancers as menacing, or even villainous, due to the close association with death. Not all necromancers are evil, but the forces they manipulate are considered taboo by many societies.</p>\n<h3>School of Necromancy Features</h3>\n<p>2nd Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.dgctauRUIdVT4XLD]{Necromancy Savant}, @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.sCXJ3eB8O48DaD3a]{Grim Harvest}</p>\n<p>6th Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.ZKsFEMB7PQL36XYM]{Undead Thralls}</p>\n<p>10th Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.E8pRfOGwgGY0X2Vs]{Inured to Undeath}</p>\n<p>14th Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.YkYHSqIyAvxs8dlf]{Command Undead}</p>\n<h2>Order of Scribes</h2>\n<p>Magic of the book-that's what many folk call wizardry. The name is apt, given how much time wizards spend poring over tomes and penning theories about the nature of magic. It's rare to see wizards traveling without books and scrolls sprouting from their bags, and a wizard would go to great lengths to plumb an archive of ancient knowledge.</p>\n<p>Among wizards, the Order of Scribes is the most bookish. It takes many forms in different worlds, but its primary mission is the same everywhere: recording magical discoveries so that wizardry can flourish. And while all wizards value spellbooks, a wizard in the Order of Scribes magically awakens their book, turning it into a trusted companion. All wizards study books, but a wizardly scribe talks to theirs!</p>\n<h3>Order of Scribes Features</h3>\n<p>2nd Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.nvEgZpXLdZ7s8oHX]{Wizardly Quill}, @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.ZlzWIERa0URixqQc]{Awakened Spellbook}</p>\n<p>6th Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.vt9UtnjwHEFXqu5w]{Manifest Mind}</p>\n<p>10th Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.p9tOVQiWnVbUndop]{Master Scriviner}</p>\n<p>14th Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.v52hoCwY6XaY3FDy]{One with the Word}</p>\n<h2>School of Transmutation</h2>\n<p>You are a student of spells that modify energy and matter. To you, the world is not a fixed thing, but eminently mutable, and you delight in being an agent of change. You wield the raw stuff of creation and learn to alter both physical forms and mental qualities. Your magic gives you the tools to become a smith on reality's forge.</p>\n<p>Some transmuters are tinkerers and pranksters, turning people into toads and transforming copper into silver for fun and occasional profit. Others pursue their magical studies with deadly seriousness, seeking the power of the gods to make and destroy worlds.</p>\n<h3>School of Transmutation Features</h3>\n<p>2nd Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.zLjBPncMpoAac6zl]{Transmutation Savant}, @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.ivzPvitWDz2JBypv]{Minor Alchemy}</p>\n<p>6th Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.vcwbyTpjLFvsR0n7]{Transmuter's Stone}</p>\n<p>10th Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.ODlV4dGmA601GvPu]{Shapechanger}</p>\n<p>14th Level: @Compendium[cc5e.class-classfeatures.bNhjyMgtiivHgEak]{Master Transmuter}</p>\n<h2>School of War Magic</h2>\n<p>A variety of arcane colleges specialize in training wizards for war. The tradition of War Magic blends principles of evocation and abjuration, rather than specializing in either of those schools. It teaches techniques that empower a casterâs spells, while also providing methods for wizards to bolster their own defenses.</p>\n<p>Followers of this tradition are known as war mages. They see their magic as both a weapon and armor, a resource superior to any piece of steel. War mages act fast in battle, using their spells to seize tactical control of a situation. Their spells strike hard, while their defensive skills foil their opponentsâ attempts to counterattack. War mages are also adept at turning other spellcasters' magical energy against them.</p>\n<p>In great battles, a war mage often works with evokers, abjurers, and other types of wizards. Evokers, in particular, sometimes tease war mages for splitting their attention between offense and defense.
