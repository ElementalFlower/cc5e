So formidable and hideous was his temper that his subjects feared to speak his name. He was the Whispered One, the Master of the Spider Throne, the Undying King, and the Lord of the Rotted Tower.</p>\n<p>Some say that Vecna's lieutenant Kas coveted the Spider Throne for himself, or that the sword his lord made for him seduced him into rebellion. Whatever the reason, Kas brought the Undying King's rule to an end in a terrible battle that left Vecna's tower a heap of ash. Of Vecna, all that remained were one hand and one eye, grisly artifacts that still seek to work the Whispered One's will in the world.</p>\n<p>The <em>Eye of Vecna</em> and the @Compendium[cc5e.equipment-magic.H2OHzdxYidxVpzSG]{Hand of Vecna} might be found together or separately. The eye looks like a bloodshot organ torn free from the socket. The hand is a mummified and shriveled left extremity.</p>\n<p>To attune to the eye, you must gouge out your own eye and press the artifact into the empty socket. The eye grafts itself to your head and remains there until you die. Once in place, the eye transforms into a golden eye with a slit for a pupil, much like that of a cat. If the eye is ever removed, you die.</p>\n<p>To attune to the hand, you must lop off your left hand at the wrist and the press the artifact against the stump. The hand grafts itself to your arm and becomes a functioning appendage. If the hand is ever removed, you die.</p>\n<p><em><strong> Random Properties. </strong></em><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">The </span><em><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Eye of Vecna</span></em><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\"> and the @Compendium[cc5e.equipment-magic.H2OHzdxYidxVpzSG]{Hand of Vecna} each have the following random properties:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>1 @table[Artifact Properties; Minor Beneficial Properties|dmg|minor beneficial property]</li>\n<li>1 @table[Artifact Properties; Major Beneficial Properties|dmg|major beneficial property]</li>\n<li>1 @table[Artifact Properties; Minor Detrimental Properties|dmg|minor detrimental property]</li>\n</ul>\n<p><em><strong> Properties of the Eye. </strong></em><span style=\"font-family:var(--font-primary);font-size:var(--font-size-14)\">Your alignment changes to neutral evil, and you gain the following benefits:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li>You have truesight.</li>\n<li>You can use an action to see as if you were wearing a @Compendium[cc5e.equipment-magic.21A9EwxzxHZm7aYB]{Ring of X-ray Vision}.

{"name":"Orb of Dragonkind","type":"equipment","img":"icons/commodities/gems/pearl-storm.webp","data":{"description":{"value":"<p>Ages past, on the world of Krynn, elves and humans waged a terrible war against evil dragons. When the world seemed doomed, the wizards of the Towers of High Sorcery came together and worked their greatest magic, forging five Orbs of Dragonkind (or Dragon Orbs) to help them defeat the dragons. One orb was taken to each of the five towers, and there they were used to speed the war toward a victorious end. The wizards used the orbs to lure dragons to them, then destroyed the dragons with powerful magic.</p>\n<p>As the Towers of High Sorcery fell in later ages, the orbs were destroyed or faded into legend, and only three are thought to survive. Their magic has been warped and twisted over the centuries, so although their primary purpose of calling dragons still functions, they also allow some measure of control over dragons.</p>\n<p>Each orb contains the essence of an evil dragon, a presence that resents any attempt to coax magic from it. Those lacking in force of personality might find themselves enslaved to an orb.</p>\n<p>An orb is an etched crystal globe about 10 inches in diameter. When used, it grows to about 20 inches in diameter, and mist swirls inside it.</p>\n<p>While attuned to an orb, you can use an action to peer into the orb's depths and speak its command word. You must then make a DC 15 Charisma check. On a successful check, you control the orb for as long as you remain attuned to it. On a failed check, you become @Compendium[cc5e.rules-revised.AdIbYLvLb319Q1KZ]{Charmed} by the orb for as long as you remain attuned to it.</p>\n<p>While you are charmed by the orb, you can't voluntarily end your attunement to it, and the orb casts @Compendium[cc5e.spells.5oaKm9mR7KMmqA32]{Suggestion} on you at will (save DC 18), urging you to work toward the evil ends it desires. The dragon essence within the orb might want many things: the annihilation of a particular people, freedom from the orb, to spread suffering in the world, to advance the worship of Takhisis (Tiamat's name on Krynn), or something else the DM decides.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Random Properties. </strong></em>An Orb of Dragonkind has the following random properties:</p>\n<ul class=\"rd__list\">\n<li class=\"rd__li \">2 @table[Artifact Properties; Minor Beneficial Properties|dmg|minor beneficial properties]</li>\n<li class=\"rd__li \">1 @table[Artifact Properties; Minor Detrimental Properties|dmg|minor detrimental property]</li>\n<li class=\"rd__li \">1 @table[Artifact Properties; Major Detrimental Properties|dmg|major detrimental property]</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong><em>Spells.</em></strong> The orb has 7 charges and regains [[/r 1d4 + 3]] expended charges daily at dawn. If you control the orb, you can use an action and expend 1 or more charges to cast one of the following spells (save DC 18) from it: @Compendium[cc5e.spells.lKcvBnNUmKOxAu63]{Cure Wounds} (5th-level version, 3 charges), @Compendium[cc5e.spells.YniGko1A4332kwog]{Daylight} (1 charge), @Compendium[cc5e.spells.n1HyX433EipWlFSy]{Death Ward} (2 charges), or @Compendium[cc5e.spells.PZD4USdNXUBJn0EU]{Scrying} (3 charges). You can also use an action to cast the @Compendium[cc5e.spells.RIliJcPWTuRu4JJR]{Detect Magic} spell from the orb without using any charges.</p>\n<p><em><strong>Call Dragons.</strong></em> While you control the orb, you can use an action to cause the artifact to issue a telepathic call that extends in all directions for 40 miles. Evil dragons in range feel compelled to come to the orb as soon as possible by the most direct route. Dragon deities such as Tiamat are unaffected by this call. Dragons drawn to the orb might be hostile toward you for compelling them against their will.

The rod has properties associated with six different buttons that are set in a row along the haft. It has three other properties as well, detailed below.</p>\n<p><strong>Six Buttons</strong>. You can press one of the rod's six buttons as a bonus action. A button's effect lasts until you push a different button or until you push the same button again, which causes the rod to revert to its normal form.</p>\n<p>If you press <strong>button 1</strong>, the rod becomes a flame tongue, as a fiery blade sprouts from the end opposite the rod's flanged head.</p>\n<p>If you press <strong>button 2</strong>, the rod's flanged head folds down and two crescent-shaped blades spring out, transforming the rod into a magic battleaxe that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.</p>\n<p>If you press <strong>button 3</strong>, the rod's flanged head folds down, a spear point springs from the rod's tip, and the rod's handle lengthens into a 6-foot haft, transforming the rod into a magic spear that grants a +3 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it.</p>\n<p>If you press <strong>button 4</strong>, the rod transforms into a climbing pole up to 50 feet long, as you specify. In surfaces as hard as granite, a spike at the bottom and three hooks at the top anchor the pole. Horizontal bars 3 inches long fold out from the sides, 1 foot apart, forming a ladder. The pole can bear up to 4,000 pounds. More weight or lack of solid anchoring causes the rod to revert to its normal form.</p>\n<p>If you press <strong>button 5</strong>, the rod transforms into a handheld battering ram and grants its user a +10 bonus to Strength checks made to break through doors, barricades, and other barriers.</p>\n<p>If you press <strong>button 6</strong>, the rod assumes or remains in its normal form and indicates magnetic north. (Nothing happens if this function of the rod is used in a location that has no magnetic north.) The rod also gives you knowledge of your approximate depth beneath the ground or your height above it.</p>\n<p><strong>Drain Life</strong>. When you hit a creature with a melee attack using the rod, you can force the target to make a DC 17 Constitution saving throw. On a failure, the target takes an extra 4d6 necrotic damage, and you regain a number of hit points equal to half that necrotic damage. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.</p>\n<p><strong>Paralyze</strong>. When you hit a creature with a melee attack using the rod, you can force the target to make a DC 17 Strength saving throw. On a failure, the target is paralyzed for 1 minute. The target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on a success. This property can't be used again until the next dawn.</p>\n<p><strong>Terrify</strong>. While holding the rod, you can use an action to force each creature you can see within 30 feet of you to make a DC 17 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, a target is frightened of you for 1 minute. A frightened target can repeat the saving throw at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

You gain proficiency in the Persuasion skill, and you double your proficiency bonus on checks made with that skill. In addition, you gain rightful ownership of a small keep somewhere in the world.
